To run this game, install at least version 0.8.0 of the LOVE 2D game engine. Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/Red Hat, and SUSE
users should be able to find the 0.8.0 prelease in the package manager under the name 'love'. If it is not available in your distro's
repositories, you can download the latest version from http://love2d.org/
If the game doesn't work, your system might have an older version of Löve preinstalled. Try updating to the latest.
